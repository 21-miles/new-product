Sometimes, the world surprises us with its mysterious and wondrous phenomena. For instance, did you know that there are lakes that can spontaneously combust due to the presence of methane gas?

## Dive Into the Depths of the Oceans and Discover Their Hidden Secrets

The ocean is a vast and mostly unexplored territory. Scientists believe that more than 80% of the ocean is still undiscovered, and new species are continuously being found. Among these strange creatures are bioluminescent organisms that glow underwater, creating eerie lights in the dark depths^2^. From the dazzling and colorful fish to the creepy, anglerfish that lure their prey with light, the ocean is full of secrets waiting to be uncovered.

## The Astonishing Properties of Elements You Use Every Day

Every element on the periodic table has its own unique set of properties that can be both useful and, at times, astonishingly strange. Take Gallium, for example.

It's often used in thermometers as a safer alternative to mercury and can even be used in high-temperature cooking.
